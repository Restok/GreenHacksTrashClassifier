# GreenHacksTrashClassifier

Are Starbucks cups recyclable or trash? Why are napkins incinerated but paper powels compostable? If you've ever been confused about where to throw your trash, don't worry, we've been there too. 

Only 35% of household recyclable items are actually recycled, and throwing waste in the recycle can contaminate the entire bin and waste materials. Mismanaged waste cost billions of dollars a year. In this project, our goal was to develop a global and accessible solution to ensure trash is properly sorted to reduce waste and preserve natural resources.
